    "detail": "I’m a _Digital Craftsman_: a full-stack developer and software designer with 19+ years of experience building clean, scalable, and user-centric solutions.\n\nMy expertise spans **front-end architecture** (design systems, custom CSS frameworks, advanced UI/UX, 3D experiences with Three.js) and **back-end engineering** (Azure, .NET, Node.js, DevOps pipelines, cloud infrastructure). I bridge **design sensitivity and engineering rigor**, ensuring code quality matches user experience.\n\nBeyond tech, I’m also a **creative and entrepreneur**: I produce music, design comics, and drive community-focused art projects in Galápagos. This mix allows me to see technology not just as code, but as a way to **tell stories, solve problems, and create cultural impact**.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nI like to describe myself simply:\n\n &nbsp; \n\n- 🚀 I build robust and scalable systems\n- 🎨 I design clean, usable interfaces\n- 🌱 I create artistic and community projects"
